# Copy-Edit

Sublime Text introduced the amazing idea of multiple selections, but its
default copy/paste semantics leave something to be desired.

Copy-Edit changes that. Ever wanted to copy multiple multi-line chunks
of text, and then correctly paste each of them? Now you can!

Ever wanted to paste three items to six selections, repeating items when
you run out? Done and done!

Ever wanted to paste six items to three selections, two per? We've got
that too!
